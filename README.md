## Overview

Surf recreates the best parts of CustomCurve Pro and adds modern UX touches: interactive curve editing, independent horizontal/vertical tuning, profile management, sandboxed testing canvas, bias multipliers, and a responsive dark theme — all in a single-file Python/Tkinter app.

---

## Key Features

* Input DPI & in-game sensitivity with instant preview
* Interactive curve editor (horizontal + vertical): add, move, remove control points

  * Add point: double-click
  * Remove point: right-click a point
  * Move point: hold left mouse and drag
  * Zoom: mouse wheel
  * Pan: middle mouse button + drag
* Curve bias sliders for independent horizontal/vertical multipliers (0.1x — 3.0x)
* Profile system: save/load JSON profiles, rename, delete, import/export via file dialog
* Import `.ccurve` files and convert/apply them instantly
* Sandboxed test canvas — visual, real-time mouse movement simulation and gain readouts (no system changes)
* Modern dark theme with responsive scaling compatible with Windows 10/11

---

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/awarzu/Surf/releases)
2. Extract the package
3. Run the executable file directly — no manual setup required

```bash
git clone https://github.com/awarzu/Surf/releases/tag/v1.0.4r2
cd Surf
python surf.exe
```

---

## Controls & Interactions (in-app)

* Add point — Double-click on graph
* Delete point — Right-click an existing point
* Drag point — Left-click + drag
* Zoom — Mouse wheel over the graph
* Pan — Middle mouse (wheel) + drag
* Bias sliders — Adjust horizontal/vertical sensitivity curve multipliers
* Profile management — Use the profile panel to create, rename, delete, import, export

---

## Testing Area

The built-in test canvas simulates mouse movement with current curve + DPI + sensitivity settings, showing:

* Current gain (live numeric readout)
* Trajectory preview
* Option to reset the simulated pointer

This is intentionally sandboxed — Surf does **not** modify system mouse settings.

---

## Profile Format (JSON)

Example of a saved profile (pretty-printed):

```json
{
  "name": "my_profile",
  "dpi": 800,
  "sensitivity": 2.0,
  "horizontal": {
    "bias": 1.0,
    "points": [[0.0, 0.0], [0.5, 0.6], [1.0, 1.0]]
  },
  "vertical": {
    "bias": 1.0,
    "points": [[0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 1.0]]
  }
}
```
